They don’t do that at the liquor store. “Hi, what sort of drunk are you looking for today? I recommend this one for calling old girl friends and the Chianti is nice for sobbing about your father. Of course, if you’re looking to call your mother-in-law a whore, I’d stick with a brown liquor. Same goes for if you’re looking to let the gay guy in your building blow you. And for anything like falling asleep on the kitchen floor, or putting a pizza in the oven and forgetting about it, you gotta try our malt liquor. Now, if this is a really special night, and you’re thinking of walking up to the taco bell drive-through window, I would recommend a sweet wine. And vodka’s always great for getting a tattoo of a rocket that looks like a dick. Numeral: now that we have Doritos with new flavors, how about ones with a more refined culinary pallets?

That wasn’t toilet paper on his shoe, it’s a price tag. He grubs for every penny. He wasn’t above cheating his charity — Trump University was a pyramid scheme. He just put a G7 meeting in one of his golf clubs. There’s not a dollar he’s ever left on the table since he took office. He’s worried about Ukrainian corruption?

This is Donald Trump we’re talking about — like he’d ever pony up even if he lost a bet. That would involve two things he’s never done: admit defeat and pay a bill. Okay so forget the bet. I got a better idea. How about this: just take my check for one million dollars. My check for a million, and I bet I could get another thousand people just from here to the beach — included Malibu, of course — who would pay that much to see you resign. And to those out there who are saying, “my god, Bill, are you suggesting we pay this man to go away?” Yes, that’s exactly what I’m suggesting. In fact, I’m insisting.

Yes, I said bill-ionaire, cuz the kind of money I could get from, just off the top of my head Oprah, Cher, Madonna, Gaga, Bono, Jay-z, Beyoncé, Pink, Rihanna, Usher, Pharrell, Eminem — and that’s just the ones with one name.
