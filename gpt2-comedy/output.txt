Women, The Jews, The priests, You all got it. And it’s going to stay with me for the rest of my life, an ignorance of the Holocaust. And I don’t think it’s okay for a Jew to walk up to a man and say he’s a Holocaust denier ’cause that’s what the Holocaust deniers do. It’s weird ’cause they’re the only ones that say it. They’re the only ones that want to know, like, “What’s Hitler’s name?” I mean, they’re the only ones that want to know. It’s like a bunch of other people have a problem with Hitler’s name ’cause they remember him from the Holocaust. And it’s weird because they’re the only ones that’ll remember Hitler. They’re the only ones that remember him. So that’s not a problem for a Jew to have. It’s a problem for a Jew to have. It’s going to keep on staying with me for the rest of my life.

love was a very good concept that I suppose. “I’m gonna buy myself a pike.” But in reality, it was a very, very bad idea to find a pike. I had to stop looking. My face was starting to get very pale and I had to go crazy. So I went back to the store, got a hard-on, bought a pike and went back to the pier. And I’m in the store, looking through the window, I find out that my pike is actually the real deal. I’m in the store, with a hard-on… And my face just started to get very pale.

And then I just sort of like… “What is going on with this guy?” You know what I mean? Just sort of looking at the phone, “Oh my God, that’s a pike.” You know what I mean? It kind of kicks off one day… I don’t even know what’s happening. “Oh, that’s a pike.” Eventually, I’m gonna take a nap. And I’m like, “Okay, that’s cool
