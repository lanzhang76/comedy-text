Women, The Jews, The priests, You all got it. And it’s going to stay with me for the rest of my life, an ignorance of the Holocaust. And I don’t think it’s okay for a Jew to walk up to a man and say he’s a Holocaust denier ’cause that’s what the Holocaust deniers do. It’s weird ’cause they’re the only ones that say it. They’re the only ones that want to know, like, “What’s Hitler’s name?” I mean, they’re the only ones that want to know. It’s like a bunch of other people have a problem with Hitler’s name ’cause they remember him from the Holocaust. And it’s weird because they’re the only ones that’ll remember Hitler. They’re the only ones that remember him. So that’s not a problem for a Jew to have. It’s a problem for a Jew to have. It’s going to keep on staying with me for the rest of my life.
